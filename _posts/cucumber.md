In the software industry I hear a lot of people say "We use Cucumber as the testing framework".   
But should you?

In this blog post, I will tell you why Cucumber is not a testing framework and why you should not use Cucumber solely as a "testing framework".

Then what exactly is it and how should I use it???    
It is a tool that supports Behaviour-Driven Development(BDD) and you should use it mainly as a collaboration tool between the three amigos (business analysts, developers and testers) It does provide you with the option to write executable tests.


Don't trust me? You should check out this article written by Aslak Helles√∏y (co-creator of Cucumber) himself:
